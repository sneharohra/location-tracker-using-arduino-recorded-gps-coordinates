# Location Tracker given Arduino recorded location coordinates 
#### This was a Final Project in my MSCS Bid Data Course. Our professor recorded all his locations in the summer months by putting an Arduino Board in his car. 
The task was to preprocess these recorded locations to figure out where the professor spent most of the time. We had to analyze where he spent short durations,
long durations and even days. We had to mark these different duartion spots with different colors and put it in a KML file.
At the end, we had all the locations our professor went to, we knew where his house was located and where he went on a vacation.
